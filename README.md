# Median-Cubital-Vein

This project aims to detect position of Median Cubital Vein.
It is used for venipuncture because venipuncture is less painful at this site. Although this is one of the largest vein but it is not always easy to detect because its visibility depends on skin color, blood condition, ailments, and many other factors, so to make detection process a little easy we collected data set of arm in which location of median cubital vein is marked with the black color. This makes our detection process more accurate because laptop’s camera is used for the real time detection in our project and image quality wasn’t good. Background is also very important for the detection, in case of our project background will be same for all the detection, so in data collection step we used same background for all the images i.e., white which not only show consistency with our real model but also increased model detection accuracy. We trained YOLO v4 for Median Cubital Vein detection using Google Colab.
